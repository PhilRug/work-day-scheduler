# work-day-scheduler
a helpful time management tool to organize your workday

Do you need a way to organize your day? Are you great at being productive but not so much on time management? Then this app is for you! Using dayjs and local storage, I have created a way to generate a current work calender whos time slots will change color depending on the time of day. This was my first attempt at using jquery and bootstrap as well as dayjs so this was a much easier project to code than the previous one.
